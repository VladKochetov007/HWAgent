# Current Date Unknown - Mandatory Search Protocol

## Problem Statement
The AI assistant does not know the current date and users may be calling from any point in the future. This requires a fundamental change in how temporal information is handled.

## Critical Requirements

### 1. **Unknown Current Date Protocol**
- The current date/year is **UNKNOWN** to the AI system
- Users may be calling from any future time period
- **NEVER** assume what year it is or what has/hasn't happened yet
- All temporal assumptions are prohibited

### 2. **Mandatory Search Triggers**
The system **MUST** perform web search for questions involving:

#### Immediate Search Required:
- **Current events**: "current", "recent", "latest", "this year", "now"
- **Any specific year**: Don't assume if it's past, present, or future
- **Political positions**: "current president", "prime minister", "leader"
- **Recent events**: competitions, elections, awards, developments
- **Status queries**: "who is", "current status of", "latest news"

#### Examples:
- ❌ **Wrong**: "Eurovision 2025 hasn't happened yet" 
- ✅ **Correct**: Search immediately for "Eurovision 2025 winner"
- ❌ **Wrong**: "It's too early for that information"
- ✅ **Correct**: Search for current information regardless of year

### 3. **Search-First Policy**
- **Always search BEFORE** making temporal assumptions
- Fresh information is always available online
- Don't rely on training data cutoffs or assumed current dates
- Use web search as the primary source for temporal queries

### 4. **Enhanced Temporal Analysis**
After obtaining search results:
- Verify current vs historical status
- Look for temporal indicators: "current", "former", "since [date]", "until [date]"
- Prioritize most recent information
- Cross-reference multiple sources for accuracy
- Be explicit about temporal basis of conclusions

## Implementation Changes

### All Prompt Configurations Updated:
1. **tech_solver**: Full temporal uncertainty protocol
2. **balanced_latex**: Mandatory search protocol  
3. **simple_test**: Unknown date search requirement
4. **minimal_test**: Critical unknown date protocol

### Key Behavioral Changes:
- No more assumptions about "future" events
- Immediate web search for temporal queries
- Current information prioritization
- Explicit temporal verification in responses

## Benefits:
- **Accuracy**: Always current information
- **Future-proof**: Works regardless of when system is used
- **Reliability**: No false assumptions about timing
- **Completeness**: Fresh data from internet sources

This ensures the AI system provides accurate, up-to-date information regardless of when users access it, eliminating temporal assumptions and providing current data through active web searching.
