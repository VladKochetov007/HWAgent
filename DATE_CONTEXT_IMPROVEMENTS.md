# Date Context Improvements for Enhanced Web Search

## Overview
Enhanced the web search tool to provide explicit date context for LLM, ensuring that temporal queries receive proper current date information for accurate interpretation.

## Problem Addressed
The user reported that the search tool was not finding the most recent year results. The issue was that while the system added the current year to queries, the LLM lacked explicit context about the current date when interpreting results.

## Solution Implemented

### 🗓️ Prominent Date Context Display
Every search result now starts with a clear date context header:

```
📅 **CURRENT DATE CONTEXT: 2025-05-31 (Year: 2025)**
```

### 📋 Enhanced Result Analysis
Each search result includes temporal relevance indicators:

- **Current Year Data**: `🕐 **CURRENT YEAR DATA (2025)** - Most relevant for current events`
- **Historical Data**: `📅 Historical data from 2024 (1 years ago)`

### ℹ️ Contextual Notes
Added explanatory notes to help LLM understand temporal context:

```
ℹ️ **Note**: When evaluating results about events like Eurovision, Olympics, or competitions,
consider that the search was performed on 2025-05-31. Results about '2025' events
should be prioritized as most current, while older years represent historical data.
```

### 🎯 Temporal Analysis Guide
Comprehensive temporal guidance for LLM:

```
**🎯 Temporal Analysis Guide:**
• Search performed on: 2025-05-31
• Current year: 2025
• For events like Eurovision, Olympics, championships - prioritize 2025 data
• Older years represent historical winners/results
• If no current year data found, the event may not have occurred yet in this year
```

## Technical Implementation

### Key Changes Made

1. **Enhanced Output Format** (`_execute_impl`):
   - Added prominent date context header
   - Included temporal relevance indicators for each result
   - Added comprehensive temporal analysis guide

2. **No Results Case**:
   - Even when no search results are found, date context is provided
   - Explains that events may not have occurred yet in the current year

3. **Tool Description Update**:
   - Updated to emphasize automatic date context provision
   - Mentions temporal analysis capabilities

### Code Examples

#### Date Context Header
```python
response_lines = [
    f"📅 **CURRENT DATE CONTEXT: {current_date} (Year: {current_year})**",
    f"🔍 **Search Results for '{query}'**",
    # ... rest of response
]
```

#### Temporal Relevance Detection
```python
# Extract year from result for temporal awareness
years_in_result = re.findall(r'\b(20\d{2})\b', f"{title} {snippet} {content_summary}")
most_recent_year = max(years_in_result) if years_in_result else None

if most_recent_year == str(current_year):
    response_lines.append(f"🕐 **CURRENT YEAR DATA ({most_recent_year})** - Most relevant for current events")
```

## Benefits

### For LLM Understanding
- **Clear Temporal Context**: LLM always knows the current date when interpreting results
- **Relevance Indicators**: Easy identification of current vs historical data
- **Event Timing Awareness**: Understanding of whether events have occurred in the current year

### For User Experience
- **Accurate Responses**: LLM can provide more accurate answers about current events
- **Temporal Distinction**: Clear separation between current and historical information
- **Event Status**: Understanding of whether events have happened yet in the current year

### For Search Quality
- **Consistent Context**: All search results include temporal reference points
- **Smart Prioritization**: Current year data is clearly marked as most relevant
- **Historical Perspective**: Older data is properly contextualized

## Usage Examples

### Eurovision Query
```
📅 **CURRENT DATE CONTEXT: 2025-05-31 (Year: 2025)**
🔍 **Search Results for 'Eurovision winner'**

1. **Eurovision 2024 Results**
   📅 Historical data from 2024 (1 years ago)
   📄 Loreen won Eurovision 2024 for Sweden...

2. **Eurovision 2025 Information**
   🕐 **CURRENT YEAR DATA (2025)** - Most relevant for current events
   📄 Eurovision 2025 will be held in...
```

### Query Without Results
```
📅 **CURRENT DATE CONTEXT: 2025-05-31 (Year: 2025)**
🔍 No search results found for query: 'Eurovision winner'

ℹ️ **Note**: Search was performed on 2025-05-31. If you were looking for 2025 events, 
they may not have occurred yet or may not be widely reported online.

**🎯 Temporal Context:**
• Current date: 2025-05-31
• Current year: 2025
• For events like Eurovision, Olympics, championships - check if they have occurred in 2025
```

## Impact on Search Results

### Before Enhancement
- LLM received search results without clear temporal context
- Difficult to distinguish between current and historical data
- Uncertainty about whether events had occurred in the current year

### After Enhancement
- **Explicit Date Context**: Every response starts with current date information
- **Temporal Indicators**: Clear marking of current vs historical data
- **Event Awareness**: LLM understands the timing of events relative to search date
- **Consistent Guidance**: Standardized temporal analysis across all queries

## Configuration

No additional configuration required. The system automatically:
- Retrieves current date from web sources or system date as fallback
- Adds temporal context to all search responses
- Provides consistent date formatting and guidance

## Future Enhancements

1. **Time Zone Awareness**: Include time zone information in date context
2. **Event Calendars**: Integration with event scheduling data
3. **Seasonal Context**: Awareness of typical event timing (e.g., Eurovision in May)
4. **Historical Patterns**: Learning from past event dates for better predictions
