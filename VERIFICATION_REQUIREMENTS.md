# Python Verification Requirements for Technical Tasks

## Overview
Enhanced HWAgent system now includes mandatory Python verification for all technical and computational assignments.

## Key Requirements

### For Technical/Computational Tasks, ALWAYS:

1. **Create Python Verification Script**
   - Generate comprehensive Python script with detailed step-by-step verification
   - Script must methodically check EVERY part of the assignment solution
   - Include extensive print statements showing each calculation step
   - Verify both intermediate and final results

2. **Ensure Result Consistency**
   - Python calculations MUST match LaTeX solution results exactly
   - Script should serve as complete verification of LaTeX solution
   - Any discrepancies must be identified and resolved

3. **PDF Generation**
   - User ALWAYS receives compiled PDF via pdflatex engine
   - This is non-negotiable for all technical documentation

## Workflow Enhancement

### Standard Process:
1. Analyze the technical task/assignment
2. Create Python script for calculations and verification
3. Execute script and collect all outputs
4. Create comprehensive LaTeX document including:
   - Problem statement
   - Solution methodology  
   - Step-by-step solution
   - Python verification results
5. Compile LaTeX to PDF using pdflatex engine
6. Verify consistency between Python results and LaTeX solution

### Quality Assurance:
- Python script validates each mathematical step
- Print statements show intermediate calculations
- Final verification confirms solution accuracy
- LaTeX document incorporates verification results
- PDF compilation is always successful

## Examples of Technical Tasks Requiring Verification:
- Mathematical problem solving
- Physics calculations
- Engineering computations
- Statistical analysis
- Numerical methods
- Algorithm implementations
- Data processing tasks

## Benefits:
- **Accuracy**: Double-checking via Python computation
- **Transparency**: Step-by-step verification visible
- **Reliability**: Automated validation of manual calculations
- **Completeness**: Both computational and documentation deliverables
- **Consistency**: Python results match documented solutions

This ensures that every technical solution is both computationally verified and properly documented with professional LaTeX formatting.
